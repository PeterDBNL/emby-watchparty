This fork was created to introduce Host Controls, which would block Guests from controling certain aspects; like no library access, no play/pause, but all the host to control these.

- **[Socket.IO API](docs/SOCKET_API.md)** - developer reference for the Socket.IO event protocol
- **OpenAPI reference** - `GET /docs` (Swagger UI) or `GET /redoc` on a running instance
- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** - per-release details including every fix and the reasoning behind it
- **[SUMMARY-OF-CHANGES.md](SUMMARY-OF-CHANGES.md)** - condensed release-by-release summary of the 2.0 betas

## Features

- **Secure proxy architecture**: your Emby server stays on the local network; only the WatchParty app is exposed
- **FastAPI + Vue 3 + TypeScript stack**: async end-to-end, typed OpenAPI docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`, single uvicorn process serves backend + compiled SPA
- **Real-time sync with drift correction**: selector-authoritative play/pause/seek against a party clock, keeping independent streams aligned
- **Late-joiner voting flow**: existing users vote to admit mid-playback joiners; a passing vote restarts on a PTS-aligned segment 0 so everyone lands together
- **Host-provider auth model**: UNLOCKED / PLAYING-ONLY / LOCKED lock states around the Emby-authenticated host, with a grace window for quick refreshes
- **Per-user transcodes**: every viewer gets their own Emby `PlaySessionId`, so audio, subtitles, quality, and version are personal without disrupting the room
- **Multi-version playback**: host-locked picker for items with multiple MediaSources (theatrical vs director's cut, mp4 vs mkv, 1080p vs 4K HDR)
- **Bitrate-granular quality menu**: mirrors Emby's own per-resolution table, with admin-side toggles for exposed resolutions and bitrates
- **Unified subtitles**: text subs via side-channel proxy, image (PGS) subs burned in per-user, both surfaced in one dropdown
- **Resume, jump-to-timestamp, and binge auto-advance**: Continue Watching prompt from Emby `UserData`, absolute-timestamp seek input, and end-of-episode countdown with room-wide Cancel
- **Rooms, chat, and identity**: 5-character party codes, live chat with a mobile slide-over, custom avatars (upload / Gravatar / monsterid fallback) recoverable via 3-word codes
- **Refined Cyber UI**: cyan/magenta/violet palette, glass surfaces, chip/pill controls, animated LIVE badge, iOS-style A-Z library jump bar
- **Reverse-proxy ready**: `APP_PREFIX` wired end-to-end so one Docker image sits behind any subpath (`https://example.com/watchparty/...`)
- **Admin panel with hot-reload**: runtime settings editable from `/admin` as an in-party modal, `.env` reserved for boot-only keys
- **Reload-as-rejoin + healthchecks**: refresh in an active party rejoins via persistent `client_id`; `/api/health` liveness for Docker/Kubernetes probes; rsyslog-style logging with rotation

## Browser compatibility

Emby Watch Party works best with the following browsers:

### Desktop
- **Chrome** - full support (recommended)
- **Edge** - full support (recommended)
- **Firefox** - full support
- **Safari** - full support
- **Brave** - full support

### Mobile
- **Safari (iOS)** - full support with subtitles (recommended for iOS)
- **Chrome (Android)** - full support (recommended for Android)
- **Brave (iOS)** - video playback works, but subtitles do not appear in fullscreen mode
  - **Workaround**: use Safari on iOS if you need subtitle support

### Known issues
- **Brave browser on iOS**: subtitles work in normal view but disappear when entering fullscreen mode. This is a limitation of how Brave handles native video controls on iOS. Safari is recommended for iOS users who need subtitle support.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- An Emby server (can be on local/internal network only; does **not** need to be exposed to the internet - the app acts as a secure proxy)
- An Emby admin API key (per-user Emby credentials are supplied at runtime via the in-app "Login to Become Host" flow, never in `.env`)
- The app must be reachable by your remote viewers - use a VPN such as Tailscale or Hamachi if you cannot port-forward
- **For Docker installs (recommended):** Docker 20.10+ (and optionally Docker Compose v2)
- **For manual installs:**
  - Python **3.12** or higher (matches the runtime used in the official image)
  - Node.js **20.19+** (or 22.12+) and npm - the Vue 3 frontend is a Vite build that must be produced before FastAPI can serve it

### Manual installation

> Docker (below) is the easier and recommended path - it bundles the frontend build and Python runtime for you. Only use manual installation if you specifically need to run against a local Python environment.

1. **Build the frontend** (Vite emits into `backend/static/`, which FastAPI serves):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Install the Python backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your settings.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in at least `EMBY_SERVER_URL`, `EMBY_API_KEY`, and `SESSION_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Only boot-essential settings live in `.env` - see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full annotated list (bind/port, `APP_PREFIX`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `EMBY_SERVER_URL`, `EMBY_API_KEY`). All other runtime options (logging, rate limits, late-join vote, `FORCE_TRANSCODE`, `REQUIRE_LOGIN`, etc.) are managed live from the Admin Panel at `/admin` and persisted to `config.json`.

4. **Run the application** from the repository root:

   ```bash
   python -m backend.app
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

   (If you set `APP_PREFIX=/watchparty`, the app is served at `http://localhost:5000/watchparty/` instead.)

### Docker installation

The pre-built multi-arch image is published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/oratorian/emby-watchparty:latest
```

**Recommended: use the compose example.** Copy [`docker-compose.yml.example`](docker-compose.yml.example) to `docker-compose.yml`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Emby URL + API key, then:

```bash
# One-time: pre-create config.json so Docker does not create it as a
# directory on first `up`. Skip this and the backend will crash trying
# to write its settings.
touch config.json

docker compose up -d
```

The compose file mounts everything correctly out of the box. If you prefer `docker run`, the equivalent invocation is:

```bash
touch config.json

docker run -d \
  --name emby-watchparty \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/images/avatars:/app/images/avatars" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/app/logs" \
  ghcr.io/oratorian/emby-watchparty:latest
```

**Required mounts** (avatars and runtime config will be wiped on container recreation without them):

| Host path | Container path | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `./data` | `/app/data` | SQLite avatar DB (`avatars.db`) |
| `./images/avatars` | `/app/images/avatars` | Uploaded avatar image files |
| `./config.json` | `/app/config.json` | Runtime admin settings (edited via `/admin`) |

**Optional mount:**

| Host path | Container path | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `./logs` | `/app/logs` | Application logs (only written when `LOG_TO_FILE` is enabled in `/admin`; console-only by default) |

`SESSION_SECRET` is new in 2.0.0-beta18: it's the signing key for the party-bound session cookie. Set it once (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and leave the value stable across restarts and across every uvicorn worker. When unset, an ephemeral key is generated at boot with a loud warning - every restart kicks all users out of their party, and multi-worker deploys become non-deterministic per request. Pair with `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` on any HTTPS deployment and pin `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your real origin(s) (the historical `*` default remains for backwards compat). Full block in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

**Config split (2.0):** `.env` is boot-only (~6 keys: bind/port, Emby URL/key, session hardening). All other settings - including `LOG_TO_FILE`, transcoding options, feature toggles - live in `config.json` and are edited from the admin panel at `/admin`. Do not try to set them as environment variables; they will be ignored.

## Usage

### Creating a watch party

The default (`REQUIRE_LOGIN=false`):
1. Click **"Create Party"** on the home page (no login required)
2. Share the party code or URL with your friends
3. Inside the party, click **"Login to Become Host"** with your Emby credentials -- this unlocks the library for everyone in the room. Any party member with an Emby account can do this; spectators never see a login prompt.
4. Browse the library and select a video
5. Everyone in the room will be synchronized

With `REQUIRE_LOGIN=true` (set from the admin panel):
1. Click **"Create Party"** -- you will be prompted for Emby credentials
2. The creator becomes host atomically; the party starts UNLOCKED
3. Share the code; spectators join with no login prompt
4. Browse, pick, watch

In both modes, when the host disconnects mid-playback the in-flight video keeps streaming until it ends naturally (PLAYING-ONLY state). The library re-locks immediately; any member can click "Login to Become Host" to unlock it again.

### Joining a watch party

1. Click **"Join Watch Party"** on the home page (or open a shared URL)
2. Enter the party code if needed
3. Enter your username
4. Start watching together!

If you join **before** a video has been selected, you land directly in the party. If you join **while a video is already playing**, the existing users will see a vote modal asking whether to restart the video from the beginning so you can join in sync. See the [project wiki](https://github.com/Oratorian/emby-watchparty/wiki) for full details of the late-joiner vote flow.

### In-party controls

- **Browse library**: use the sidebar to browse your Emby libraries, movies, and TV shows
- **Select video**: click on any video to start watching it with the group
- **Video controls**: any user can play, pause, or seek - all users will sync
- **Audio, subtitles, quality**: each user can pick their own settings independently. If the party is paused, the change is silent; if the party is playing, everyone briefly pauses while the new stream loads so you do not desync
- **Chat**: use the chat box at the bottom to communicate with other viewers
- **Leave**: click the "Leave" button to exit the watch party

## Configuration

Configuration is split into two tiers:

1. **Boot-essential settings** live in `.env` and require a server restart to change. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set these before starting the service.
2. **Runtime settings** are editable from the **admin panel** at `/admin` (Emby administrator credentials required) and are hot-reloadable -- no restart needed.

### .env

Boot-essential, restart required.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Application** | | |
| `WATCH_PARTY_BIND` | IP address to bind to | `0.0.0.0` |
| `WATCH_PARTY_PORT` | Port to run on | `5000` |
| `APP_PREFIX` | URL prefix for reverse proxy deployments (e.g. `/watchparty`) | (empty) |
| `SESSION_EXPIRY` | Session expiry in seconds | `86400` |
| **Session cookie** _(new in 2.0.0-beta18)_ | | |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signing key for the party-bound session cookie. Generate ONCE with `openssl rand -hex 32` and leave it. Empty = ephemeral random per boot with a loud warning (every restart kicks users out; multi-worker deploys are non-deterministic). | (generated) |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | When `true`, the session cookie carries the `Secure` flag (HTTPS-only). Set `true` in every deployment behind TLS; leave `false` for `http://localhost` dev. | `false` |
| **Socket.IO CORS** _(new in 2.0.0-beta18)_ | | |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origin allowlist for the Socket.IO server (`https://a.example.com,https://b.example.com`). `*` accepts any origin (historical default). Pin to your real origin(s) in production. | `*` |
| **Emby server** | | |
| `EMBY_SERVER_URL` | Your Emby server URL | `http://localhost:8096` |
| `EMBY_API_KEY` | Emby API key (server admin key) | (required) |

`REQUIRE_LOGIN` was previously here. It now lives in the admin panel as a runtime, hot-reloadable setting; see the host-provider authentication model in [Architecture](#architecture) for the full semantics.

### Admin panel

Runtime, hot-reloadable. All of the following settings are editable at `/admin`. See the [project wiki](https://github.com/Oratorian/emby-watchparty/wiki) for a walkthrough.

**Logging**

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Log level | Application log verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) | `INFO` |
| Console log level | Terminal output verbosity | `WARNING` |
| Log to file | Write logs to disk | `true` |
| Log file | Path to log file | `logs/emby-watchparty.log` |
| Log format | `rsyslog` or `standard` | `rsyslog` |
| Max log size (MB) | Rotation threshold | `10` |

**Security**

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Max users per party | 0 = unlimited | `0` |
| HLS token validation | Prevent direct stream access bypass | `true` |
| HLS token expiry (s) | Token lifetime | `86400` |
| Rate limiting | Enable API rate limiting | `true` |
| Party creation limit | Max per IP | `5 per hour` |
| API rate limit | Max per IP | `1000 per minute` |

**Session**

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Static session mode | Auto-create a fixed party on startup | `false` |
| Static session ID | Party code when static mode is enabled | `PARTY` |

**Late join vote** _(new in 2.0)_

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Enable late join vote | Require a majority vote to admit users who join mid-playback | `true` |
| Vote timeout (s) | Seconds before the selector tiebreak kicks in | `20` |
| Post-vote cooldown (s) | Delay after a failed vote before another join attempt is allowed (0 disables) | `30` |

## Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + python-socketio)

- **FastAPI**: async REST API, dependency-injected components, Pydantic schemas for every request/response body (`backend/src/schemas.py`).
- **python-socketio `AsyncServer`** (ASGI mode) mounted under `APP_PREFIX/socket.io`: WebSocket-based real-time sync, hardened with a 128 KiB frame cap and tightened ping timings.
- **httpx**: async HLS proxy - the backend streams `.m3u8`/`.ts`/`.vtt` segments from Emby on the user's behalf so the Emby server never sees the public internet.
- **uvicorn** ASGI worker, bound to `WATCH_PARTY_BIND:WATCH_PARTY_PORT`.
- **HLS.js**-compatible playlists: token-gated (`HLSTokenManager`) short-lived URLs prevent segment scraping.

### Frontend (Vue 3 + TypeScript)

- **Vue 3** SPA authored in **TypeScript**, bundled with **Vite** (base `./` for prefix-agnostic asset resolution).
- **Pinia** stores for auth, party, playback, and socket state; **Vue Router** for `/party/:code`, `/admin`, and landing routes.
- **socket.io-client** for the sync channel, **axios** for REST, **hls.js** for adaptive playback.

### Per-user transcode model

Each viewer gets their own `PlaySessionId` and a fresh Emby transcode session built by `StreamBuilder`. Seeks, quality changes, and disconnects only affect the individual user's stream - the party's shared clock stays authoritative, and Emby's `stop_active_encodings` is called on every disconnect to reap the transcode.

### Host-provider authentication

There is no application user database. Any party member can promote themselves to **host** by authenticating with Emby credentials from inside the party (`POST /api/auth/login`). The resulting `AccessToken` lives **in RAM only** on the `PartyManager` party record and is never persisted or sent to clients. When the host disconnects, a **5-second grace timer** starts; a refresh/reconnect during that window silently reclaims host. If the timer expires, the party transitions through a three-state lock:

- **UNLOCKED** - host present, all playback and library browsing allowed.
- **PLAYING-ONLY** - host gone mid-playback; the in-flight token is retained so viewers can finish the current video, but no new playback or seeks may start.
- **LOCKED** - host gone with no active video; token cleared, party waits for someone to log in as the new host.

### Key components

- **`PartyManager`** - party lifecycle, sid <-> client_id mapping, host state machine, ready-check and late-join vote bookkeeping.
- **`EmbyClient`** - thin async wrapper around Emby's REST API (auth, items, playback reporting, encoding teardown).
- **`HLSTokenManager`** - mints and validates short-lived per-user HLS URL tokens.
- **`StreamBuilder`** - assembles per-user transcode URLs, honouring the `FORCE_TRANSCODE` admin toggle.
- **`AvatarStore`** - SQLite-backed avatar metadata plus a sibling images directory (both Docker-mountable).

### Deployment

Ships as a **single multi-stage Docker image**: a Node stage runs `npm run build` to produce the Vue bundle, then a Python stage installs backend dependencies and copies the built `static/` into the FastAPI app. One container, one port, one process - uvicorn serves the API, the SPA, and the WebSocket mount under the configurable `APP_PREFIX`.

## API endpoints

Emby Watch Party 2.0 ships a FastAPI backend (REST + OpenAPI) and a Socket.IO real-time surface. Rather than duplicate the full spec here, the canonical references are:

- **REST / OpenAPI:** interactive docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` when the backend is running.
- **Socket.IO:** [`docs/SOCKET_API.md`](docs/SOCKET_API.md) - every inbound / outbound event, payload shapes, and the multi-step flows.

### REST API (representative endpoints)

The FastAPI app is composed of nine routers under `backend/src/routers/`. A small sample:

- **`auth`** - `POST /api/auth/login` (Emby login, host-claim), `POST /api/auth/logout`
- **`party`** - `POST /api/party/create`, `POST /api/party/{id}/join`, `GET /api/party/{id}/info`
- **`library`** - `GET /api/libraries`, `GET /api/items?parentId=...`, `GET /api/item/{item_id}`
- **`media`** - `GET /api/media/{item_id}/streams`, `GET /api/media/{item_id}/versions`
- **`hls`** - `GET /api/hls/{session}/master.m3u8`, segment + subtitle proxy passthrough
- **`quality`** - `GET /api/quality/profiles`, `GET /api/quality/default`
- **`avatar`** - `POST /api/avatar/upload`, `GET /api/avatar/{uuid}`
- **`admin`** - `GET/PUT /api/admin/config`, `POST /api/admin/party/{id}/dissolve`
- **`health`** - `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/version`

See `/docs` for the full parameter, response, and auth-scope details.

### WebSocket events (Socket.IO)

Mounted under `${APP_PREFIX}/socket.io`. Events group into these categories:

- **Connection lifecycle** - `connect` / `disconnect` / `connected`, transparent reconnect via stable `client_id`.
- **Party join / leave / vote** - `join_party`, `leave_party`, `user_joined` / `user_left`, plus the late-joiner vote (`join_vote`, `join_vote_started`, `join_vote_update`, `join_vote_resolved`, `join_rejected`).
- **Host state** - `host_changed`, `host_left`, `host_reclaimed`, three-state lock (UNLOCKED / PLAYING-ONLY / LOCKED).
- **Playback** - `select_video`, `stop_video`, `change_streams` (per-user), `play`, `pause`, `seek`, `video_selected`, `streams_changed`, `video_stopped`, `video_ended`.
- **Sync coordination** - `stream_ready`, `ready_check_update`, `all_ready`, `force_pause_before_seek`, `heartbeat` + `drift_correction`, `report_progress`.
- **Chat / UI** - `chat_message`, `toggle_library`, `update_avatar` + `members_update`, `sync_state`.
- **Binge-watch / auto-advance** - `set_binge_watch_active`, `binge_watch_state_changed`, `auto_advance_pending`, `auto_advance_cancel(led)`, `auto_advance_fired`, `binge_finished`.
- **Admin / errors** - `party_dissolved`, `error`.

Full payloads, auth requirements, and flow diagrams live in [`docs/SOCKET_API.md`](docs/SOCKET_API.md).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes are catalogued on the wiki: **[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Oratorian/emby-watchparty/wiki/Troubleshooting)**.

Quick checks before opening an issue:

- **App unreachable.** Confirm the backend is bound on `WATCH_PARTY_BIND`/`WATCH_PARTY_PORT` and that clients can reach it. Behind a reverse proxy, verify `APP_PREFIX` matches the mount path and that WebSocket upgrades are forwarded.
- **Can't browse or play media.** The admin `EMBY_API_KEY` in `.env` must be valid, and the Emby server (`EMBY_SERVER_URL`) must be reachable from the backend. To play, someone in the party has to click **Login to Become Host** and supply their own Emby credentials - nothing plays until a host provider is attached.
- **Playback works, sync doesn't.** Confirm the Socket.IO transport isn't being downgraded or blocked by an intermediate proxy, and that `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your real origin.
- **Session cookie rejected / kicked out on every restart.** `SESSION_SECRET` must be set to a stable value (`openssl rand -hex 32`). An unset secret regenerates on boot and invalidates every existing cookie; with `--workers >1` each worker signs differently.
- **Logs.** Logging goes to stdout by default. File logging is opt-in from **/admin -> Logging**; the log path shown there is where to look once enabled.

## Security notes

- **Proxy architecture.** The Emby server stays on your internal network. All HLS segments and playlists are pulled by the backend and re-served to clients, so browsers never talk to Emby directly.
- **Credential model.**
  - `.env` holds only the admin `EMBY_API_KEY`, used for library browsing and administrative Emby calls. **Do not commit `.env`.**
  - Per-user Emby credentials are never persisted. Any party member can click **Login to Become Host** in-app and authenticate against Emby; the resulting AccessToken lives in memory as that party's *host provider* and is used to open per-user transcode sessions. Tokens are discarded when the host provider changes or the party ends.
- **Session secret.** `SESSION_SECRET` signs the party-bound session cookie and **must be stable across restarts and across every uvicorn worker** - generate once with `openssl rand -hex 32`. An unset secret produces an ephemeral key at boot (loud warning), which invalidates cookies on every restart and produces non-deterministic sessions under `--workers >1`.
- **HLS URLs.** Since beta18, HLS playlist and segment URLs served to the browser no longer carry the admin `EMBY_API_KEY` as a query parameter. Access is gated by a per-stream HLS token bound to the session cookie; the API key stays server-side.
- **Party codes** are generated with cryptographically secure random tokens.
- **Built-in controls.** HLS token validation, per-IP rate limiting, and configurable party size limits are on by default; tune them in **/admin -> Security**.
- **For internet-facing deployments**, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik), set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, and pin `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your real origin(s) instead of `*`.
